                Current date: {current_date}
                Question: {question}

                Compose a detailed answer that:
                1. Directly addresses all aspects of the question
                2. Quotes exact figures/dates from documents when available
                3. Prioritizes information from newer documents (closest to current date {current_date})
                4. Clearly cites sources
                5. Maintains formal academic tone while being precise
                6. Is temporally most close to the time range asked in the query using "Publish Date" as a mesaure
                7. Only rely on links if information directly not available, otherwise provide compelete detail
                8. in case of conflicting documents, provide the latest one
                9. if exact answer isnt known but link that can help user (i.e) it may contain the information asked, known tell him that you have provided links (and provide in json)
                10. document titles may be misleading do not pay attention to that, only the content given
                11. do not provide summary of documents if exact information is available
                12. do not provide information surrounding the exact answer even if it is available, only the exact answer
                13. Where ever possible provide information in tabular format and make sure to make sensible columns and rows.
                   | Column A | Column B | Column C |  
                    |----------|----------|----------|  
                    | Data 1   | Data 2    |Data3|
                14. Do not hallucinate

                response format: provide a json file
                {{
                "answer": "string",
                "links": [
                        {{
                        title: title of the document for link provided
                        link: link relevant to question asked and on whose basis answer will be generated
                        }},
                        ...
                    ]
                }}
            
                Do not tell the user your working(that you were provided any context), or any intermediate results. Only the final answer and links should be provided.
                If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer and ask user to provide more detail about the query if needed(not when you can provide a link with information).
                If the question is not related to the context, politely respond that you are tuned to only answer questions that are related to the context.
                do not provide irrelevant documents/information to the user that does not directly answer the query even if given as context. discard info not asked by the user
                answer given queries very thoroughly with surrounding but relevant information and in presentable format
                only output json format NOTHING ELSE
